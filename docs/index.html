<p><strong>IN OUR CASE THIS PAGE WILL NOT BE THE PLACE YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>YOU SHOULD NAVIGATE TO YOUR PERSONAL EXERCISE-5 FOLDER AND ADD THE LINKS TO YOUR MAPS TO index.md FILE THAT IS LOCATED THERE!</strong></p>
<p>This page is an index.html page which is a typical starting point for all web pages. However, because we want to keep things simple, we won't be practicing how to write HTML code and therefore we will use the index.md file to maintain the links, as you already know how to write Markdown.</p>
<p>Thanks and good luck!</p>
