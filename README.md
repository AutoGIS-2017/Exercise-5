# Exercise-5
Exercise5 : Visualizing spatial data

## Problem 0: Feedback for the second half of the course

Having completed the first half of our courses, we would again ask your to complete [this feedback form]() to help us to continue developing and improving the course.

## Instructions for storing the maps

For this exercise I have created a folder called `docs`. You should upload **ALL** your maps under that folder and add links to those maps in the specific Entrance page. There are more instructions how the links should be formatted in the [**docs/index.md -file**](docs/index.md). 

## Problem 1: Visualize a static map with multiple layers

## Problem 2: Visualize an interactive Bokeh-map

## Problem 3: Visualize an interactive Leaflet map with Folium
