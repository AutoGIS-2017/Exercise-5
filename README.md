## Problem 0: Feedback for the first half of the course in Period II

Having completed the first half of our courses, we would again ask your to complete [this mid-term feedback form](https://elomake.helsinki.fi/lomakkeet/75455/lomake.html) to help us 
to continue developing and improving the course.

## Instructions for storing the maps

For this exercise a folder called `docs` have been created the Exercise 5 repository. You should upload **ALL** your maps under that folder and add links 
to those maps in the specific Entrance page (index.md) that is also located under that folder. There are more instructions how the links should be formatted in the [**docs/index.md -file**](docs/index.md). 

## Problem 1: Visualize a static map with multiple layers on it

Play around with the data that was provided for you and used during the lesson and **create as interesting, good and beautiful STATIC map(s) that you can**. 

Upload your maps to the `docs` folder and create link to those map(s) in the `index.md` file. **Use your imagination**, you can e.g. do some calculations on the current datasets 
or use also the analyses that we have done earlier in the course. 

But notice that the main aim here is that you try to do the visualizations as best as you can, thus the subject what you are presenting is not important.  

## Problem 2: Visualize an interactive map

Play around with the data that was provided for you and used during the lesson and **create as interesting, good and beautiful INTERACTIVE map(s) 
that you can** using either Bokeh or Folium or both. 

Upload your maps to the `docs` folder and create link to those map(s) in the `index.md` file. **Use your imagination**, you can e.g. do some calculations on the current datasets 
or use also the analyses that we have done earlier in the course. 

But notice that the main aim here is that you try to do the visualizations as best as you can, thus the subject what you are presenting is not important.
