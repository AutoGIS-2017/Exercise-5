## Problem 0: Feedback for the first half of the course in Period II

Having completed the first half of our courses, we would again ask your to complete [this mid-term feedback form](https://elomake.helsinki.fi/lomakkeet/75455/lomake.html) to help us 
to continue developing and improving the course.

## Instructions for storing the maps

For this exercise a folder called `docs` have been created the Exercise 5 repository. You should upload **ALL** your maps under that folder and add links 
to those maps in the specific Entrance page (index.md) that is also located under that folder. There are more instructions how the links should be formatted in the [**docs/index.md -file**](docs/index.md). 

## Problem 1: Visualize a static map with multiple layers on it

## Problem 2: Visualize an interactive Bokeh-map

## Problem 3: Visualize an interactive Leaflet map with Folium
